To compile:

--  This is a C program so gcc is the compiler
--  The client and server programs must be compiled separatedly

gcc client.c -o client
gcc server.c -o server


To run:

--  Two separate windows are required
--  First window:
	./server
--  Second window:
	./client


** NOTE: **
--  If the two windows are on the same system, the host name is localhost
--  Choose a port number > 1024
